=== INTERPRETATION GUIDE ===,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KEY METRICS EXPLAINED:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPL_Max_ms,Maximum execution time from CLEANED data (outliers removed) - represents typical worst case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPL_Raw_Max_ms,Maximum execution time from ALL data (including outliers) - represents absolute worst case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPL_Outlier_Count,Number of outlier executions detected (out of 50 total),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPL_DSL_Ratio,Performance ratio - how much slower/faster PPL is vs DSL (1.0 = equal performance),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance_Outlier,Yes = Query is an outlier compared to other queries; No = Normal performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Outlier_Reason,"Why query was flagged - e.g., Slow_vs_DSL, High_Outlier_Rate, Slow_PPL_Absolute",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HEALTH INDICATORS:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metric,Healthy,Needs Attention,Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPL_Outlier_Count,0-2,3-5,>5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Raw vs Clean Max Difference,<10%,10-25%,>25%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPL_DSL_Ratio,Within normal range for dataset,Approaching threshold,>Dataset threshold (>2.21x for this run),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PPL_Success_Rate,≥95%,80-95%,<80%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance_Outlier,No,-,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HOW TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMATIC QUERIES:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Check Performance_Outlier column,Yes = Query needs investigation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Check PPL_Outlier_Count,>5 outliers = Inconsistent performance (network/cluster issues),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Check PPL_DSL_Ratio,"Check Outlier_Reason for actual threshold (data-driven, was 2.21x for this dataset)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Check PPL_Success_Rate,<95% = Query reliability issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Compare PPL_Raw_Max_ms vs PPL_Max_ms,>25% difference = Large performance spikes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
